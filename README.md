## Introduction

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains my solutions and explanations for the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023 in Go.

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, ranging from easy to difficult. Participants from around the world take on these challenges to improve their programming skills and have fun solving puzzles.
